"less but better". it's the curation of belongings -minimalists can love things, because things can and should be treasuredand last forever, so we should ensure that we buy the best version ofwhatever we purchase.</p><p>i have no interest in wearing the same uniform every day, but stickingto incredibly muted colors like blacks and deep blues allows me to wearwhatever with whatever, so i don't really have to think about outfits.maybe in the future i'll reduce what i wear to a simple uniform, but fornow i enjoy expressing myself too much to limit what i wear to thatdegree.</p><p>i aspire to own no physical books, and i've pared down every'collection' of mine to either the items in the collection that I use orto none at all. one of my main goals is to be portable - i don't want tohave to make any decisions when packing because i will own exactly whati need to bring with me - nothing less and nothing more. eventually, asI live, experience, move and am exposed to more, i will have a betteridea of what i need and will be able to continue to get rid of all thatI do not. for now, though, i am stuck in the limbo of college education,between my parents' home and temporary apartments and a potentialpermanent residence, and with many belongings i may still have a needfor in the future.</p><p>as i learn more about myself, i'll know precisely what products i need -and i'll be able to either purchase them or make them myself. i'll alsobe able to cut back on consuming the media i don't enjoy and focus onwhat i need as i begin to build more of a community and a following, butfor now social networking tools like instagram are indespensable to mypersonal interests. understanding yourself is probably the mostdifficult thing you can do, but once this has been mastered -understanding yourself as you exist now, understanding your ideal self,and swiftly closing the gap between them - you will be able toaccomplish exactly what you'd like to with absolutely minimal friction,which is the ultimate optimisation.</p><h3 id="bill-watterson-and-calvin-and-hobbes">bill watterson and calvin and hobbes</h3><p><a href="https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/bill-watterson-and-the-perfect-artistic">https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/bill-watterson-and-the-perfect-artistic</a>calvin and hobbes as we know it is incredibly different from watterson'sinitial work, but he made significant choices, completely avoiding fameas he worked and developed his comic strip while refusing to license anysort of tshirts, toys, or media outside of the comic strip he maintains.he quit working on the strip entirely, completely owning all of therights to his work and continuing to live with the legacy of the comic.</p><p>every new work seems to decrease the quality of legacy, cheapening thework with halfassed accessibility and reperformance that in realitycorrupts the original work completely. staying 'in the game' too long,the author argues, considerably cheapens the art - you should be able tofind your peak, and choose to bow out at the peak unless you know you'vedeveloped something significant enough to impact legacy. always considerwhat you want to gain from your work and what you want your work torepresent - without that focus, your words might be lost to deterioratein quality or face hypocrisy outright.</p><h3 id="the-problem-with-the-car">the problem with the car</h3><p><a href="https://apexsnotes.substack.com/p/the-car-and-the-world">https://apexsnotes.substack.com/p/the-car-and-the-world</a> the car can bea literal engine of freedom – used to allow for some alone time andndependence. this article is stupid, it uses big words and talks big buthas no real substance. blah blah blah the resolution is obviously tobuild places that do not require cars, but there is no proposition forhow this can and should be accomplished. sure, public spaces shouldoffer some privacy that the car currently plays the role of, buthonestly there should no longer be a need for cars in major cities.</p><h3 id="bestselling-by-poe">bestselling by poe</h3><p><a href="https://poecansaveyourlife.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-bestselling-writer">https://poecansaveyourlife.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-bestselling-writer</a>weird that poe wasn't necessarily some super depressed dude, he justwrote what people would buy and continued to do it, rather thanexpressing himself 'purely' and self publishing everything until helanded on the idea of good marketing</p><p>start with a commercial genre then elevate it: take what people aredoing now and criticise it, twist it, play with it and make somethingfun and new. if it's already commercial, it's already been tried andtrue, so there is plenmty of room for new success.</p><p>write the first line of your next thing:<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/07/why-stephen-king-spends-months-and-even-years-writing-opening-sentences/278043/">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/07/why-stephen-king-spends-months-and-even-years-writing-opening-sentences/278043/</a>make sure the opening line invites the reader to begin the story. thefirst line should tell you everything - what it contains and doesn'tcontain populates the story, improving and exaggerating it to providweinteresting context and allow you to just jump in. first sentencesshould always stick with you - they are wonderful and should betreasured.</p><p>also, aim for a hundred rejections a year - actively seek rejectionbecause it means you're trying and making moonshots!! if just onepercent of your attempts are successful, the one attempt couldabsolutely kill it. all that matters is consistency of effort andcontinuing to force shit out of consistently excellent quality untilsomething sticks with someone, then something else with someone else,and suddenly you've built a community. carefully track these mistakesbecause they show progress! they show your success. fail again and failagain and fail better. remember that rejection is a conversation; ifit's rejected, then it's at least been seen! - so do not dreadsubmitting, because it's liberating to throw shit at the fan even ifnothing sticks. the feedback, if done well, should be invaluable.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-2306-article-collection"><a href="/journals/2021-06-21.html#2306-article-collection">2306-article-collection</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-minimalism"><a href="/journals/2021-06-21.html#minimalism">minimalism</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-bill-watterson-and-calvin-and-hobbes"><a href="/journals/2021-06-21.html#bill-watterson-and-calvin-and-hobbes">bill-watterson-and-calvin-and-hobbes</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-the-problem-with-the-car"><a href="/journals/2021-06-21.html#the-problem-with-the-car">the-problem-with-the-car</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-bestselling-by-poe"><a href="/journals/2021-06-21.html#bestselling-by-poe">bestselling-by-poe</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2021-06-21.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2021-06-22.html">2021-06-22</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2021-06-15.html">2021-06-15</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
