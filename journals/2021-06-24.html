regardless, i'll keep up myposting regimen to ensure that i'm holding myself accountable in termsof my creative goals - three posts a week no matter what.</p><p>there are too many places to go and too many things to do but i know ineed to just focus on one or a few. i'm a good software engineer and ishould continue to hone that skill. what else?</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-1244-workout-pro-tips"><a href="/journals/2021-06-24.html#1244-workout-pro-tips">1244-workout-pro-tips</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-1"><a href="/journals/2021-06-24.html#1">1</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-work-2"><a href="/journals/2021-06-24.html#work-2">work-2</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-conclusion"><a href="/journals/2021-06-24.html#conclusion">conclusion</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2118-perceived-effort-where-it-counts"><a href="/journals/2021-06-24.html#2118-perceived-effort-where-it-counts">2118-perceived-effort-where-it-counts</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2021-06-24.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2021-06-25.html">2021-06-25</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2021-06-23.html">2021-06-23</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
