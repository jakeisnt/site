My life will be unstructured for the nextcouple of months before I start full-time work, and I've realized that Ineed some things every day to ensure that I stay productive, healthy,active and social! Nothing here is complex. Here's the breakdown ofthings I have to make time for every day:</p><ul><li>Exercise. 30+ minutes. Can be biking across the city to get to/fromsomewhere, time at the gym or soccer. I don't feel good without it.</li><li>Sunlight in the morning. It works. Don't know why. Wakes you up.</li><li>Cooking at least once: It's super important to practice essentialskills every day, and nothing is more beautiful than cooking. Don'tbuy bullshit. Make it from 'scratch': buy the plants, spice (not spicemixes), and cuts of meat, and make it happen. Worth investigating<strong>growing</strong> things as well.</li><li>Completing something I can show to someone else. Having goals orstories or whatever is one thing, but looking at a ton of backendplumbing and saying 'Look! I did that!' is incredibly unsatisfying. Ascool as the work is, it's important for that work to matter to someoneelse. It won't feel satisfying otherwise. Connect it to a UI element,allow someone else to test or read it, publish it on the internet.Regardless of how your stuff gets out there, making it usable byothers is the most important step. (This allows you to receive thanksand get feedback - the best motivation and the best way to learn,respectively).</li><li>Dedicated social time. I need to spend time with someone I care aboutwho I don't see every day, enjoy a concert, or enter an environmentwhere I can meet some cool people. Social energy is incrediblymotivating for building and for life - we live for the people in ourlives, and any 'work' I do should directly connect to other people.There's no better way to connect to others than to speak to themface-to-face, so this has to happen.</li><li>1:1 technical conversation This usually goes hand-in-hand with the'completing something' point, but may be separate depending on theproduct. To keep learning about technical topics in breadth or depth,and to advance a career, it's going to be super important to not onlylearn about innovations, but also to discuss how they work, how theymight be implemented, etc. Maybe there's a cool library, or a newmathematical approach to something, or a new paradigm for X;regardless of the details of the conversation, it has to be withanother person, one-on-one.</li><li>\[Weekly\] 'networking' events. 1:1 works but it's a bit of a crutch,and it's easy to fall into this trap of not meeting any new people.New people are beautiful and there are so many ways that they canbenefit you; you're just one person, so meeting another person whocares about what you care about is multiplicative. And maybe you'llmeet more! The only way to learn more is to be exposed to more. Also,it's really difficult to cultivate social skills speaking withexisting friends; you generally can predict how they'll react or howyour interaction will go. The people you meet and spend time withshould be new and unexpected. There is no other way to learn.</li></ul><p>This could help make a calendar - i.e. "Oh, I have to fill the socialgap or the networking gap or the sports gap!" - or something. I do wantto explicitly block time out for these things - right now I just do thisin my head, but it should make it onto paper someday.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-friday-12092022"><a href="/journals/2022-12-09.html#friday-12092022">friday-12092022</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-1833-taking-away-and-adding-structure"><a href="/journals/2022-12-09.html#1833-taking-away-and-adding-structure">1833-taking-away-and-adding-structure</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2022-12-09.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2022-12-10.html">2022-12-10</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2022-12-06.html">2022-12-06</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
