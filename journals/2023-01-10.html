The sixty-something year old has a full head of white hair, aworn and sunspot-dressed light complexion, and a complete, well-trimmedbeard; the boy slim and ambiguous with a baggy hoodie and joggers. Atthe boy's request, the man is telling him about his life as if it's aninterview; growing up Catholic in Mexico, moving to the U.S., meetingthe boy's mother, and so forth. He is most interested in prayer - theCatholic faith that has ebbed and flowed throughout the man's life as helives and endures chemotherapy. This feels like a hello to the boy, aconversation with someone who's become more conscious of himself, but agoodbye to the man, straying from chemo to what his vision of Jesus orGod is like. How do you envision Him? Why does he matter? What does hemean at this point of his life?</p><p>I'm thinking about faith, about progress, about position and status; I'moperating in between the two, as a fresh college graduate looking forfaith, for a cause, for company, for some purpose and way to believe insome cause or movement for the rest of my life. I'm looking forsomething to focus on without giving up, like I have many pastdecisions, many past lives, as I sell most of my clothes and pack mybags to move halfway around the world, to Stockholm, which has alwaysbeen a bit of a fantasy. Now it is less so, as I realize I cannot escapemy upbringing and family and friends and people I've known my wholelife; rather, I must focus on maintaining, repairing, and building uponwhat I already have, regardless what's happened in the past, to build afuture. I'm no longer looking to find a new world; rather, I'm lookingto form a community, to add myself and to bring others; and to makebeautiful, lifelong connections. I want to marry, to have children, andto raise them, and to cultivate a loving environment for them, for me,for everyone.</p><p>They're moving to morality; he's skipped class before, but it felt sowrong, but he can look for guidance from above, from company, fromsomewhere, to find what's right. I love the radical transparency thatboth of them have, that I've never had, at points because I believed itwas wrong, or not worth the effort, or when I didn't know how. Maybewhat's right is to build the dreams of another; to go full-speed-aheadon Commonwealth Fusion Systems and cold fusion, or to heal cancer andalzheimer's, or to build a future for software development and GUIprogramming and programming languages. Maybe I have a future inindustrial design and architecture, in curation, in building and makingthings for people to best suit their needs. I fear academia and nothaving a customer, not meeting the needs of real people anywhere downthe stack, though I find the discourse fascinating. Turkle and Papertand Kant gush about objects and their meaning to people and to oneanother, and my biases help me tend towards the same; I've come tobelieve that the right objects and possessions, the ones that best fitmy needs, the <strong>best</strong> ones, are more valuable than anything else,though perhaps time with friends and people I love is even greater thanthat.</p><p>"It's just middle school" is self-dismissive; to believe that this timeis bad not for you, but for everyone, feels defeatist. Today is the besttime to be alive, and tomorrow will be better: believing that tomorrowwill not improve for years is to not accomplish anything while waitingfor progress. Ambient progress doesn't necessarily exist. The only wayto make progress is to make the change yourself, taking step by step bystep by step by step by one by two by three by four by five until you'vepositively affected your life.</p><p>I have no idea if this is true, or correct, but I'm convinced thatbelief that progress starts with you, and that the world must getbetter, and that it must be improved by you, is the best thing tobelieve, because to believe anything other risks feeling doomed, andlost, and discouraged and demotivated. Maybe the best cause to worktowards is the suboptimal one, the one that stands out first and has themost support; maybe the best action is taking action, no matter thecause, to see how these abstract ideas I have about constructing systemsto evoke feelings in people can manifest in technology, to help makecomputers fun and to help people see and find the same fun in and powerover computers that I do.</p><p>This conversation also brings to mind the lenses and filters of thinkingI've been considering. A conversation has four parts - your relationshipwith the other participant, what they have to say, what you considerreplying with, and the lens through which you examine your reply. Youare not to respone right away, but to hesitate, to listen carefully anddeliberately and to filter your instinctual response through a lens ofwhat's best for the other person, to give them the best gift you cangive them.

The filter youselect has to both convey your taste and respect that of the otherparticipant - how do they want to receive information? What is the bestway to convey it?</p><p>How can we grow together?</p><p>The boy was in a fistfight about his family, about basketball, aboutreligion, fundamentally; and to progress, the man says, you must be firmbut not argumentative, confrontational but not strict; you must demandof your fourteen-year-old opponents to stop.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-tuesday-01102023"><a href="/journals/2023-01-10.html#tuesday-01102023">tuesday-01102023</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-1938"><a href="/journals/2023-01-10.html#1938">1938</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2023-01-10.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-01-12.html">2023-01-12</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-01-08.html">2023-01-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
