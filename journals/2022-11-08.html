Glad thewiki is mostly shaping up; occasionally performing some BFS "groom" ofthe system is already paying dividends. Learning a lot about my writing,how to keep it terse and focused and cut and cut and cut until I get towhat really matters.</p><p>Still believe that computing and education is one of the biggestproblems to be solved today, but not as big as the energy crisis. Whatelse is there that can be solved outside of governance?</p><p>Not sure where I stand on "cool". Cool is a great way to understand whatpeople find culturally interesting, and it's this pyramid of obsessionwith cool that peaks with characters who make meaningful creativecontributions, but is really held together by those who act as "glue",showing up to every party and knowing everyone interesting andconnecting them to one another and to people who are ostensibly "lesscool". Chasing cool seems silly for my role, but incidental cool seemsincredibly useful.</p><p>Noticing that I usually have a great decision making ability after a fewminutes of insight; my first impression is usually not correct, butcontinuing to waffle wastes a ton of time for me without producing anyreasonable insight. The boots I buy really don't matter that much, but Ithink I've made the right decision for something sustainable andrepairable going forward that'll fit my look (a bit academic, a bitRick, a bit retro; as if I stepped out of Apple's R&D in the 80s butsomeone threw Ricks on my feet). Leveraging traditional "educational"looks with interesting sillhouettes. Still waffling about makingclothing down this path. No graphics though. Or very few. Just makeimpulse purchases, rotate them through, and drop them when they don'tfit the wardrobe. Gym will come through soon enough.</p><p>Still dreaming about compact function stores and lisp methods ofcomputing. I'll build these. Window manager as papertian metaphor stillinteresting, but definitely have to use browser DOM and run some JS torender these things. My compromise will be not using React and buildingmy own thing. Maybe I'll come up with some novel notion of state butI'll probably reimplement reactive programming somewhere down the line.</p><p>In same vein as cool - maybe optimizing for cash is good. Short termit's great to have more flexibility and choice in life. Long term itgives you more options, choices and agency. Cost is that you"compromise" by optimising for arbitrage that makes money withoutproviding value; fear is that you are capturing far more value than youare creating for others without working towards some global goal. Lotsof very smart people spend their whole lives working on very nobleprojects that don't matter, though - maybe these contributions to theliterature are okay, and who's to say who knows what's worth bettingon - not me.</p><h2 id="2344-teaching-is-social-problem">23:44 teaching is social problem</h2><p>so much of teaching computers is social. most of the teachers i knowwhen faced with teaching computing are going to ask the people they knowand their friends, and the acquaintance who works at intel is going totell them that yeah, I use C, and my buddies all do machine learningpython things, and the teacher is going to take one look at smalltalk orgtoolkit or "beginner student language" and say fuck, i'll read somecoding bootcamp medium articles and teach my kids how to program withthe C language. hard to express or understand that what is in vogue nowisn't necessarily the best for learning from first principles, and maynot be necessary for learning at all now or forever because tech changesso so so so fast. can't sell another language or framework or technologyto teachers unless they're particularly inventive or agentic. this is asocial problem reliant on external perceptions of computing; becausepeople don't understand their computers beyond these programminglanguage things and hacking and terminals, then also use these completeapps, they never develop agency for themselves and as such never reallyunderstand what it is to control something they own, and never reallyunderstand what it means to control another comptuer and use computingwith agency. it's vicious!</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-tuesday-11082022"><a href="/journals/2022-11-08.html#tuesday-11082022">tuesday-11082022</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2320-usual-day"><a href="/journals/2022-11-08.html#2320-usual-day">2320-usual-day</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2344-teaching-is-social-problem"><a href="/journals/2022-11-08.html#2344-teaching-is-social-problem">2344-teaching-is-social-problem</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2022-11-08.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2022-11-10.html">2022-11-10</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2022-11-07.html">2022-11-07</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
