Extremely formal doesn't fit. Those fabrics are stiff and not breathable. It's hard to feel comfortable! Loving the modern 'workwear' brands - some cuts of Our Legacy, AFFXWRKS, ACNE Studios - and silver jewelry with chunks taken out of it. Completely avant-garde is too impractical - I'm not out to win any awards - but repairable Rick boots are a great compromise. I want clothes that can be worn every day without wearing out, that can be repaired and maintained and reworn and that show their age slowly, but don't have to be carefully taken care of; fabrics that look hard-wearing rather than fuzzy or fragile.</li></ul><p>This puts Our Legacy's lyocell experiments out of the picture. Unsustainability aside, the fabrics so quickly stretch and reform and are so so fragile - I don't want to have something else to take care of. Linen is a beautiful fabric for sheets - and feels great as a garment - but doesn't look like it's robust. I don't want something I wear to tear and fall apart as I live daily life.</p><p>Clothing that wears texturally without losing color also seems important. Denim wear is visible in the dye; as the cotton stretches, color is lost in some places and gained in others. In the meantime, the clothes are absurdly uncomfortable. 'Futuristic' fabrics, by contrast, stretch and contract and scratch - and these blemishes are visible in the texture of the items but not in the color. Paint and stains show, sure - but those are added, not removed from the garment.</p><p>Also loving neutral and deep blues. Beige is great for sheets but doesn't feel like it fits me - something to do with my skin tone. Warm blues match the eyes. AFFXWRKS work is brilliant - futuristic workwear. A bit too colorful and too Prada-infused to like most of the items - but some of the pants are masterpieces. They nail the workwear pant construction but use futuristic-feeling breathable, robust fabric. More of that please.** 16:53How do I know whether other people are open to being reached out to? How do I reach out to them?</p><p>This is easy in New York or Italy or Portland or Seattle or Boston - it was so easy to approach people and ask questions about them, their outfit, what they were up to, and so on... but here people feel far more reserved and the language barrier is difficult.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-05-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/735f8f532efe4b3324ed555124ad4cf863f41dd6//2023-05-20.md">735f8f53</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-05-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/50476919914634eb3d591bad51fc7e3b3fea1d26//2023-05-20.md">50476919</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-05-21.html">2023-05-21</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-05-19.html">2023-05-19</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
