The threads of continuity are fascinating and so tight-knit -most of these central European graphic designers - whether Swiss,American, German, or Italian - seem to know well or be inspired by oneanother, with each genuinely innovative in their own way. \[I'm surethere are far more type designers, brand designers, et cetera… but theinfluence is relatively thin\]. Do we have clear influences from thelast twenty or thirty years through today? The internet after the early90s has led to this cambrian explosion of entirely exposed internationalinfluence - my are.na account takes influence from work all over theworld over the course of the past two hundred or so years.</p><p>How are we going to trace influences today when most are more 'abstract'and less direct? I.e. – with so much information, designers look less toemulate elements and ideas from other individuals, and more likely havethis entire historical body of work in mind, drawing influences from allof these different places and synthesizing them. The internet documentsconnections between people in an incredibly expressive way - that nohistorical evidence could match - but the new continuities left by newpeople become much more muddy. We're globally aware now - there is somuch work going on in parallel, and it's often hard to assess the scopeof the field: who's worth paying attention to? Is everyone the best inthe world at something? What are the best tools for the job? Who shouldI allow myself to be influenced by?</p><p>And so forth. I think the answer here is - as always - to focus on workand not worry about it. I'm not sure how important tracking influencereally is outside of this social network graph. As long as influences ofmine are explicitly documented - at least implicitly, on timelines -it'll all be fine. I need to focus on doing more work and not worryabout it.</p><p>Equally concerning, though, is the ability to consume this endless feedof work without regard for its past. This is no different from walkingthrough a city without knowledge of architecture - see cool building,appreciate it without understanding the historical taste that led to itslook - but it's not controversial that understanding background andhistorical motivation helps people better learn about and appreciatetheir environment. The best tool for design is google image search, andeven that can rarely handle live web apps and websites, and it usuallyleads to some short description on Pinterest. I'll keep trying to figurethis out - still have images of animations of evolutions of structuresin my brain.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-tuesday-01032023"><a href="/journals/2023-01-03.html#tuesday-01032023">tuesday-01032023</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-0243-what-do-historical-legacies-mean-for-the-internet"><a href="/journals/2023-01-03.html#0243-what-do-historical-legacies-mean-for-the-internet">0243-what-do-historical-legacies-mean-for-the-internet</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2023-01-03.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-01-08.html">2023-01-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2022-12-29.html">2022-12-29</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
