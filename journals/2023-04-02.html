Dogged a weight limit on my checked bag on the way. Paid an $100 fee for some clothes I'll discard soon. They should have been left here, but I'm not sure how to find a home for them. I know that I'm bad at letting go - but also that caring for the items and concepts and people in my life is my greatest strength - so I can't let it go. A feeling of indifference about life is worse than anything imaginable and I refuse to forfeit what I love.</li></ul><p>Cried in the Uber the whole way to the airport. Arman and Phoebe are such beautiful, incredible people; the longer I know them, the more thankful I am that they're a part of my life. All of the chalk drawings Phoebe left - all of the generosity storing my things - everyone so willing to accomodate me - I am so grateful. I can't believe how lucky I am to have friends like Benjamin or Gus or Margot or Ameya or anyone. Bonds between people are best when you don't have to have explicit boundaries or rules between one another. Boundaries are healthy, yes - but when you can trust someone unconditionally - to know they'll do the right thing without sharing a word - they will be a part of your life forever. I can't wait to meet more people like them.</p><p>A bit about how the people in my life in Boston have left such a positive impact on me -</p><p>Arman, you've taught me how to open up to and care for people. Your ability to welcome people into your life so swiftly and so comfortably - to make such fast friends, to keep following up and keep people around, to care so deeply about so many people so as to not forget about them or miss a second of time out with them - is unparalleled. I've met many people who tend to form communities in their orbits - and you succeed because everyone you open up to you care about so deeply. I've never felt as comfortable with a roommate as I have with you - and you've consistently brought new people into my life over the years. you make everyone around you feel so welcome to spend time with you and your life will continue to be beautiful for it.</p><p>Phoebe, you've taught me how to love every little moment of life. Every second you spend with someone is another opportunity to treasure them and the time you spend together. No moment in line or time in a queue or dinner cooking session is mundane with you - every little step is an opportunity to dance a bit. Your fascination with everything old and new that you discover is beautiful to witness - and your passion for everything in your life is infectious. (In recent memory, you resurrected my Minecraft addiction...) Thank you for enjoying silly little things like drawing with chalk in front of 20 Royce Road or walking around the block or washing dishes with me. You'll find a way to turn the passion you feel for everything into a career and a life that you love. Just give it time.</p><p>Thank you both for helping me move out until the last second. You both give great hugs.</p><p>I've covered fewer people than I planned, but I'm boarding my connection to New York in a second - then I'm off internationally. I'll see you soon.** 05:21phoebe, jake, sewing and process failuresi'm impressed by how well engineering processes are designed to managep eople and their emotions. Nothing is an individual's responsibility - everything is considered a process failure unless it's very, very bad -</p><p>** 18:42if learning to love a place is to take vite after bite after bite until you can swallow it whole, to leave is to disassemble, brick by brick by brick until there is no longer a wall between you and the world</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-04-04</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/137fb58213fd8cfa144121780e23c6d3bb7c5ef3//2023-04-02.md">137fb582</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-04-02</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/9c2a24942158f4c153cbdd408eb1ca8763f7dcf2//2023-04-02.md">9c2a2494</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-04-02</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/c6731c791d15ff05a899fa40660944d53f7d1b51//2023-04-02.md">c6731c79</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-04-04.html">2023-04-04</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-03-30.html">2023-03-30</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
