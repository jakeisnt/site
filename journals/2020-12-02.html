Out of writing?</p><p>i want to learn more about myself and my relationship with the world. Ilove ava's approach: synthesizing philosophy writing with current eventsand experiences, and putting her personal experiences through old ideas.</p><p>I enjoy paul graham's perspectives, to a point; he approaches everythingfirst from the perspective of an engineer, then a historian, then afounder in his current position – aiming to convey what's best forfounders.</p><p>What makes all of the writing I enjoy <em>interesting</em> is thisdemonstration of abstract emotions through metaphor and parallels drawnto moments in the personal life of the writer. It's important not to gettoo personal – names are deliberately obscured and personal interactionsare mangled, anonymized or sanitized for the sake of narrative – but toestablish a personal connection with the reader it's vital to let themin. Too personal can be seen as personally invasive or downrightdangerous, revealing circumstances that could compromise yourwell-being, safety or career.</p><p>Treat the piece as good conversation – your intention is to establishyourself as the reader's equal, not mentor. Mentorship, like much ofGraham's writing, is completely patronizing. Sure, you can craft agallery of admirers if you write well, but as your reader begins todisagree with your sentiments – inevitable in such an egoist framework –you become irrespectable. Allow the reader to play an equal part in theconversation! Provide them an introduction that puts them in the properframe of mind. Once they're thinking like you, you can develop a paththey can follow into your own life experiences: one that helps themlearn about you just as much as it does about themselves.</p><p>Weave in and out of anecdotes with personal references and effects.Without these, you haven't given the audience other ways to interactwith the ideas. There is no such thing as writing without reference, andby explicitly citing them we include them in the conversation, too. Thisgives your reader the saem understanding of the material you, as thewriter have – and when they see eye to eye, they can make the sameconnections to their lives that you can.</p><p>Try to impart a tidbit of a life lesson in each passage. Don't treatthis as something you <em>know</em> and feel that you <em>have</em> to convey to thereader; treat the information you're imparting as a way you feel or aperspective you have on a part of your life, and try to figure out howto share that with them – and encourage them to adopt the practice aswell.</p><p>There are not good writers, only good editors – we can start by writingwhat we know, but this isn't worthy of publication until it's editedseveral times. Become your own editor and master the craft!</p><p>"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you'velaunched too late." – Reid Hoffman</p><p>What do I want to write about? What do I bring to others that'svaluable?</p><ul><li>Technical knowledge. I've done a lot of research about many softwaretools and I've programmed enough to know how to use many of them.</li><li>Crafting a minimal lifestyle. Learning to live and travel with less.</li><li>Developing taste. I know what objects I'm interested in, what I likewearing and how I like my spaces to look.</li></ul><p>I don't necessarily have to write about things I have experience withalready; rather, the act of writing can be a jumping off point forresearch and ideas to spring up! This holds for any subject – startingto <em>do</em> will start things off better than any other effort. Of course,it's much more difficult to research Foulcaultian ideas than it is todebug some code or read some new documentation – but it's valuablenonetheless!</p><h2 id="2341-good-resources-for-creative-branding-and-making-clothes">23:41 good resources for creative branding and making clothes</h2><p><a href="https://virgilabloh.com/free-game/">https://virgilabloh.com/free-game/</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpsWewtxXw">how to screenprint</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFagJKMgo84">how to find blanksto print to</a> figures ofspeech catalog <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAO3kGA27Jg">peter saville, building thebrand</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2a68oZxdfM">marc jacoblouis</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcYmeXYSjgQ">alife</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9JOvFEjGes">yohji</a></p><h3 id="photo">photo</h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg0HCtgCjg">how to shoot a lookbook</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gdFwKiKf_8">how to be a radicalphotographer</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCBVl2mLOfE">film andshoot lookbook on iphone</a></p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-1904-substack-writing"><a href="/journals/2020-12-02.html#1904-substack-writing">1904-substack-writing</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2341-good-resources-for-creative-branding-and-making-clothes"><a href="/journals/2020-12-02.html#2341-good-resources-for-creative-branding-and-making-clothes">2341-good-resources-for-creative-branding-and-making-clothes</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-photo"><a href="/journals/2020-12-02.html#photo">photo</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2020-12-02.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2020-12-03.html">2020-12-03</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2020-12-01.html">2020-12-01</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
