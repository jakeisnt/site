margot reminded me that 23 feels like a real aduleage, where you have no excuses for being a kid and doing silly things orhave any presumed institution shielding you from the real world. 23 isreal; it's an age where I feel culpable for anything that happens, whereI feel completely responsible for my world. i've wanted this kind ofagency for a long time, and it feels both isolating and liberating -most and more aspects of my life are direct consequences of my actionsrather than downstream from something set in motion not entirely undermy control. this is good if i leverage it.</p><p>party at mine friday night after some late-night computer-aidedreasoning homework; i'm getting tired of these events. i just want thespace to create. saturday was margot and book fair (beautiful,inspirational work) and sitting in a park and reading mindstorms whilewatching berklee jazz musicians in Titus Sparrow park. the south end isbeautiful, historic, and reminds me a bit of new york's east village;the otherwise haphazard buildings have a uniquely uniform brownstonelook to them, the community feels incredibly diverse, and the naturemakes the place feel incredibly pleasant to walk in. music playing outof windows and in streets. weird vegan places though. that fomu cookietasted like a terrible granola bar.</p><p>reading mindstorms and helping arman learn web from scratch on sundaywas enlightening; for one, starting with a client+server web applicationis a disgusting requirement for people learning to develop; if youthrust people into the deep end of software development, they'll drownand give up. i've seen this in oasis time and time again, in friends whocopy pasted demos then never touched a line of code afterwards, instudents of matthias' software development course who had no idea whatthe hell any of their code was doing when they presented it.</p><p>i buy that tools like replit and glitch.me make today's softwaredevelopment experiences more accessible for others; they allieviate thestatic costs of setting up development environments and hosting thatkeep people from building today's real-world, deployable software withtoday's tools. as a general educational device, though, these tools fallshort; they allow anyone to be able to code and develop software fromany sort of device - which is beautiful. they don't take the next stepof learning through coding, though. papert's book intends to developthis symbiotic relationship between programming the computer andunderstanding the fundamental laws of our world through the robustdevelopment of analogy and the view that, in essence, learning isdebugging some model you have with preconceptions about the world. Nodoubt, I've used robust systems like MIT Scratch, code.org and LegoMindstorms with the express intention of conveying papert's work bystarting with (literally) the concept of turtle graphics, but they throwaway any notion of more developed physics simulations by continuing toencourage their users to memorize notation about class names andconcrete syntax.</p><p>the coding environments and their silly little games in a sandbox arecute, but they never teach kids to break out - anecdotally, i built alittle model operating system in scratch in the sixth grade with afriend - complete with garbage can and painting program - but proceededto drop computer programming for years because i felt like i had hit thelimits of the medium (and i had; the program was 5 mb, somehow maxed outthe CPU power of the devices I had access to at the time, andoccasionally crashed the scratch VM). I didn't program for yearsafterwards for this reason - that i no longer saw a path forward withthe skills i'd developed through this programming environment - andbecause i had an incredible amount of difficulty attempting to translatethe skills i'd developed with this model of a programming system toother models, like python, at the time. (this then opens up anotherbox - the "which programming language should i use?" one - that keepsyou on the edge and encourages you to dip your toes in different poolsand youtube videos and blogs without diving in. I honestly think myworld would have been simpler if someone cut off the internet, passed mea common lisp textbook, and told me to start writing). I ended upexploring other cultural avenues through the consumption of fashion,music, photography and design media, but taking a break from softwareset me so far back that i fear i'll never catch up to some of my peers -and the math and science misunderstandings i have might not berecoverable.</p><p>i don't want this to happen to other people. i want people to uselearning tools that translate into real-world, deployable, "adult"things that feel no different than what is real. it's silly to me thatthere is this divide between educational tools and pragmatic ones; thetransition should be seamless and obvious. (and provides opportunitiesfor income… pay for hosting at a domain, for example).</p><p>should also encourage computing agency. introduce a metaphor for thedesktop not as a way to open programs others have created, but as aprogramming environment where all of the code in the windows is code youcan write and fiddle with and explore. my hypothesis is that buildingthis metaphor and extending it to real, production software capabilitieswill improve learning and product development demonstrably. the sandboxshould expand to the browser, to the operating system, and to shippingproducts in the real world.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-monday-11072022"><a href="/journals/2022-11-07.html#monday-11072022">monday-11072022</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-0953-birthday-weekend"><a href="/journals/2022-11-07.html#0953-birthday-weekend">0953-birthday-weekend</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2022-11-07.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2022-11-08.html">2022-11-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2022-11-03.html">2022-11-03</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
