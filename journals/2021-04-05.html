Taxes should happenautomatically, as they do in many other countries; they should flowthrough the authority and to you, not given to you and taxed muchlater - then punished for not being adaquetely satisfied. We shouldn'thave to worry about money in and of itself. We should worry about theinstitutions that mandate that we spend more time with money and lesstime on what matters. Unnecessary financial management is a real issueand, IMO, really does lead to a decreased quality of life, itnroducingadditional anxiety, etc.</p><h2 id="2123">21:23</h2></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-1023-first-one-in-a-long-time"><a href="/journals/2021-04-05.html#1023-first-one-in-a-long-time">1023-first-one-in-a-long-time</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-american-hypocrisy---public-and-open-private-infrastructure-and-lives"><a href="/journals/2021-04-05.html#american-hypocrisy---public-and-open-private-infrastructure-and-lives">american-hypocrisy---public-and-open-private-infrastructure-and-lives</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-finance-is-the-wrong-level-of-abstraction"><a href="/journals/2021-04-05.html#finance-is-the-wrong-level-of-abstraction">finance-is-the-wrong-level-of-abstraction</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2123"><a href="/journals/2021-04-05.html#2123">2123</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2021-04-05.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2021-04-06.html">2021-04-06</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2021-03-10.html">2021-03-10</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
