This used to be apattern for me, but I broke out of it by getting up early andinteracting with lots of poeple - something I haven't done at all overbreak. I need to relearn these skills and always be so open tointeracting with people face-to-face - these relationships with peopleonline are just unhealthy otherwise.</p><h2 id="2046-ui">20:46 ui</h2><p>i'm finally reaching my ui flow again with a couple of upgrades andrunning emacs as a daemon. we're a lot faster now - maybe some linuxkernel update? - but there is still so much work to do on the desktopinterface.</p><p>every program i use commits this cardinal sin of nesting windowmanagers. I love the ergonomics of something like Emacs - and I'llcontinue to use it as a text editor - but using it to manage windows andthe OS just isn't practical. Anything that uses tabs or windows shoulduse the same interface to manage them!</p><p>Concretely -</p><ul><li>My git program (mostly magit) should open in a WM-managed window, andits file previews should open in another program still</li><li>hidden tabs or buffers should be managed by the WM, not as emacsbuffers</li><li>emacs is probably the fastest way I know to manage wm buffers, and hasa super nice interface for managing terminal commands, but because ofall of its lexacy contents (and purpose) its not meant ot take overthe whole system and run expressive gui apps.</li></ul><p>in short, i want to bring the emacs workflow to the window manager, andadd expressive keyboard shortcuts, etc</p><h2 id="2216-other-ui-notes">22:16 other ui notes</h2><p>my arrow keys are way too far away lol whats a better way of triggeringthem? a shortcut? pressing two keys at once? chording feels far moreergonomic than some key combination; it 'flows' better, it feels justlike the staccato or rolling nature of typing, and it's almost morenatural in that way; the keyboard feels and sounds very similar whenchording as it does when</p><h2 id="2248-some-things-to-build">22:48 some things to build</h2><ul><li>mod+? to view all of your globally defined keyboard shortcuts</li><li>way to view all of those keyboard shortcuts: i want to be able to drawover windows with a relatively flexible format, and have some api(?)or hardcoded thing to render lists or groups of structured data in apopup window on the screen, or perhaps a menu above/below (i like theevil emacs keyboard shortcut hints/descriptions a lot, but sometimeswe also want more screen real estate, plus its easier to bring upeverything on the center of the screen)</li><li>i think eventually we end up building up to a desktop manager kind ofsystem lol - we probably also want a login manager - but we want tobuild this to support heterogenous software to start, and we want todo a damn good job of it</li></ul><p>how do we inject fun?</p><ul><li>personal, animated assistant</li><li>animations and transitions throughout. what does a joyful animation?</li><li>sound effects for everything. maybe some sort of synth that adapts asyou type to what you're doing, in some abstract sense, and motivatesyou vocally</li></ul><p>feed into a metaphor for the kitchen, or the lab, or the music studio,not the desktop; the desktop is where you do boring business things. iwant to feel like i'm chefing up some fire every time i use my device,and i watn to assemble modular tools myself.</p><p>What about a box of toys? Legos? We could extend this into some nodesystem for workflows with blocks for automations built into the OS. Lookback at previous notes for this.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-thursday-01122023"><a href="/journals/2023-01-12.html#thursday-01122023">thursday-01122023</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-1946-todays-rough"><a href="/journals/2023-01-12.html#1946-todays-rough">1946-todays-rough</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2046-ui"><a href="/journals/2023-01-12.html#2046-ui">2046-ui</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2216-other-ui-notes"><a href="/journals/2023-01-12.html#2216-other-ui-notes">2216-other-ui-notes</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-2248-some-things-to-build"><a href="/journals/2023-01-12.html#2248-some-things-to-build">2248-some-things-to-build</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//2023-01-12.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-01-13.html">2023-01-13</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-01-10.html">2023-01-10</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
