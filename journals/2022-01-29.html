there was a wonderfulcouple meeting their friend - both parties about my parents age, butthey were happy! they were enjoying talking to one another about thishouse that they'd purchased that was wonderful despite not having hadany renovations in seventy years! i don't think i've ever seen as kindof a public hug. these people are typically portland, but werecompletely out of place in somerville - i was pleasantly surprised bytheir morning pleasantries. twenty minutes before, listened to aconversation between two people in their thirties - one, a seeminglyworking class italian guy with short, spiked up and greased hair, had alot to say about his new suit, his resume formatting (just a microsoftword template??), and a lot to say about amber, a girl he'd apparentlyseduced by composing an acrostic poem on paper then DMing her a photo.</p><h1 id="do-everything-on-hard-mode">do everything on hard mode</h1><p>esp early in life<a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/">https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/</a> fail fastimprove fast. push yourself into the deep end then recover. only wa ytoprogress and make sure you hold on is to work with longer time scales -especially longer than college - and try to make those goals only wa ytoprogress and make sure you hold on is to work with longer time scales -especially longer than college - and try to make those goals happen.five year time scales are good, so are ten. thinkin terms of the futureand take all the steps you can to make that happen now. prove it toyourself! i haven't been thinking on long enough time scales and that'sa big mistake.</p><h1 id="the-hand-of-god">the hand of god</h1><p><a href="id:c1fdd31a-1ba0-4631-8bb3-38e6eab4a807">Movies</a> wonderful film iwatched with my parents over the winter - they nailed this 1980s grimyitalian aesthetic, and it's so easy to live through the scenes fabiettowitnesses daily and to observe his path from enjoying all of these smallthings to choosing to become a filmmaker himself. absolutely worthrevisiting.</p><h1 id="nocturnal-animals">nocturnal animals</h1><p><a href="id:c1fdd31a-1ba0-4631-8bb3-38e6eab4a807">Movies</a> strange and difficultto follow - don't know if i could recommend this to anyone. tom ford asa director has a strange, "abstract" take on the movie that lives inthis uncanny valley between lengthy metaphor and realistic film, andit's hard to tell what he meant by either - literally or not. wellfilmed with well composed shots, but ultimately confusing and falls flaton delivering the thinly veiled message ford wanted to convey.</p><h1 id="math">math</h1><p>$\frac{123456789}{987654321}$</p><h1 id="having-a-successful-intro-meeting">having a successful intro meeting</h1><p><a href="id:71048a30-3080-43a5-9135-2cf8365aa790">Advice</a><a href="id:5b920ce1-774c-426c-a299-54b1dc62cc36">Employment</a> at work, i've hadlots of intro 1:1s to get to know others in the company. here's thestructure i found the most valuable:</p><ol><li>Who are you?
