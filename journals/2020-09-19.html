make great 'projects'<em>"If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll everydo important work.</em> <em>Great scientists have thought through, in a carefulway, a number of important problems</em> <em>in their field, and they keep aneye on wondering how to attack them."</em></p><p>Ex.
