     <h1 class=title-top>Programming Languages</h1>
     <p><span>TLDR: I&#39;ve explored tons of languages, but ultimately I think that 
       Zig (systems) and Common Lisp (general purpose) (relatively soon: my own Lisp, 
       TBD) are worth betting on, my criteria being:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Performant. Racket, Clojure and other lisps are slow relative to Common 
        Lisp. I don&#39;t have time for a slow programming language built on some hill 
        of abstractions when high level languages that are also incredibly fast exist.</span>
      <li><span> Fast to use. I don&#39;t want to have to learn new language features. I 
        should be able to get from 0 to product as easily as possible.</span>
     </ul>

        fact that the new indentation and super simple function application without 
        parens works means that macros are far more powerful. Concrete syntax makes 
        things more readable, and doing things like defining a comment with a macro 
        advances text! It&#39;s a cool idea. You&#39;ll probably end up tripping up 
        fairly fast though... definitely a bit of a toy. Also notable that it&#39;s kind 
        of just lisp without parens and some cute re-parsing trick / re-eval at macro 
        time that allows for some more elegant concrete syntax.</span>
