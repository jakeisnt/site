Can betrapped in thoughts: these thoughts feel hard to get away from. Beforethis, stand apart from your thoughts; distance yourself from them. Focuson what you see. Have some simple, sentence-style thoughts. Think ofthings that are completely emotionally uncharged; thoughts that do notconnect to strong ideas. Do not sink completely into the thought.Realize that your thoughts change as you take in different parts of yourenvironment. Most of your experience is not comprised by this thought.</p><p>Step back from the thoughts that are happening. Do not be so enrapturedby them.</p><p>Prod some of these thoughts: how long does it take for the thoughts togo by? How heavy is the thought?</p><p>Can you stop that thought and let it go or is there something thathappens when you try to do that?</p><p>Focus your attention on a single thought. Close your eyes. What do youfeel about it? Is this a solid object or ethereal? Is it well-defined oris it indistinct?</p><p>By dropping your intention in, you are able to feel past your layer ofintention and analyze what has not been processed.</p><p>Do not have an agenda when inquiring about this sensation. Learn moreabout the sensation.</p><p>The actual sensation is neutral; it is your interpretation of thesituation that is making it negative. It's very important to realizethis.</p><p>Blow evaluates a particularly painful experience – food poisoning – andhow he can separate his understanding of the pain and their reaction toit.</p><p>We know this about pain! When we are cut, the nerve receives an impulseand this impulse is recieved by the brain, which assigns negativesentiment to these things.</p><p>Look at the sensations that help you generate this negative state.</p><p>There is probably some legitimage precedence for having developed ahabit, or a response; at some point, though, we must acknowledge thatthese processes are not inherently necessary! We can then properlyevaluate and control whether we make decisions based on this state.</p><p>Always pinpoint the source of your emotions, whether positive ornegative. You are not your thoughts. Your thoughts are very small. Stepback. Sensations are neutral. Your mind amplifies the sensations. Tryevaluating negative exercises as neutral experiences.</p><h1 id="the-good-life">The Good Life</h1><h2 id="finding-motivation">Finding Motivation</h2><h3 id="the-lesson-to-unlearn">The Lesson TO Unlearn</h3><p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html">paul graham</a> The most damaging thingyou learned in school was to get good grades.

To grow your business naturally, you need torecruit! Aggresively! Shyness and laziness prevent people from doingthis; wanting to write code and seeing the small numbers of users.Those initial users are necessary for exponential growth!</li><li>Get used to fragility. It's hard to balance a successful business,and squeezing the margins will make hte difference between successand failure. All startups are fragile! New startups can't be judgedby the standards of successful ones. It's okay to get things wrong.It's okay to fix things. It's hard to see where you're coming from.</li><li>Delight. Don't just get users, make them happy! Make users know thatsigning up with you is the best thing they could have done. Try toohard to make your customers happy.</li><li>Experience. The user experience and quality of execution should beincredible. The product doesn't have to be great, but the experienceof being a user does. Over-engage with initial users, listen to themcarefully and pay close attention to their opinions.</li><li>Fire. Focus on a deliberately narrow market at first, then widenyour breadth. Start with a subset of the market then quickly expand.</li><li>Consult. Pick a single, initial user and use them as a mold for auser to please. Recruit initial lukewarm users by using yoursoftware on their behalf and perfect the user experience and theriend.</li><li>Manual. You are your software. Do everything manually, then automateit later! This enables a faster launch, and automating out of thisloop becomes trivial.</li><li>Big. Don't do the big launch! Nobody remembers it!

The ideas you initially have will not be that deep;as such, the exciting things are at the surface level. First,understand the single exciting idea and explore it. Initial actionsprimarily focus on working with the surface-level code; determinehow to navigate the code, working with code at a top level. We needto focus on learning how to communicate to the computer!</p><p>Experienced programmers do not think about text; text is theapplication of a drawn-out idea and a developed solution. A problemis decomposed into smaller, tractale problems, then these tractableproblems can be translated into code that has been approachedbefore.</p><p>The shape doesn't start anywhere! After having an idea, yo also needto locate this starting point; from this starting point, you mustthen locate a way from which you can navigate through the idea fromthis point. Not finding the starting point is bad, worse thanchoosing the wrong starting point!</p><p>Some moments of programming involve internalizing a task so far thatit's been practiced; after performing this task so many times, youbecome accustomed to translating this task into code withoutthinking about it! This experience is incredibly powerful!</p><p>This is more like an art than an engineering – you are following anintuition, and this intuition carries you somewhere good!</p><p>Often, we get trapped by our attention: if we are deeply focused ona single way of thinking and operating at a level of abstraction, weare unable to switch contexts to another layer of abstraction veryeasily! Often it's best to back up and reevaluate the big picture.</p><p>Getting to the deep work comes from experience. You'll follow manymisguided paths and many ill-guided directions, but at the end ofthe day you will reach a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.</p></li></ol><h3 id="philosophy-in-life">Philosophy in Life</h3><p><a href="https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/04/26/guide-to-the-good-life">finding the goodlife</a>According to stoicism, the good life is:</p><ol><li><p>The Good Life</p><ul><li>Virtuous: depending on how well one can perform the function forwhich they are dedicated</li><li>Negative visualization: the fear that bad things will eventuallyhappy isn't healthy!
