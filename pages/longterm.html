However, long periods of concentration are vital for aprogrammer to better understand their code and succeed. This crazydedication helps develop unhealthy habits and can prevent you fromproperly focusing.</li><li>Concentration periods are the most important part of programming.Losing concentration means losing all context, and losing all contextmeans that you'll spend lots of time reorienting yourself and enteringa stronger period of focus.</li><li>It's difficult to adjust, and this leads to substantially decreasedproductivity. To improve:</li></ul><ol><li>Embrace interruptions. Learn to accept interruptions and avoidgiving up through them.</li><li>Maintain context outside of your head at all times. Alwaysexplicitly comment and track what you're doing, teh decisions you'remaking. etc. Externalizing thoughts can help you clarify them! Everyso often, make sure to record these (the author does this at 30minute intervals).</li><li>Ignore tangental issues. Focus on the singular current task anddon't worry about things that could get you sidetracked! Write thosedown with a ticket system that's fast, lightweight and agnostic tothe amount of detail put into these thoughts. The most importantthing to do is to put this idea away until it can be summoned in afuture context.</li><li>Always know of the one thing you will do next.</li><li>Prioritize negatively :: assume baseline that you will not do any ofthe tasks, then assess the negative outcomes of not doing each one.Perform the task that will have the most negative outcome first.</li><li>Recognize the benefits of breaks. Breaks have great benefits,encourage better health, and can offer a new context from which theproblem can be tackled!</li></ol><h2 id="50-ideas-that-changed-my-life">50 ideas that changed my life</h2><p><a href="https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life">https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life</a> inversion ::avoiding stupidity is easier and better than being brilliant doublespeak:: saying the opposite of what one means theory of constraints :: focuson the bottleneck, the weakest point of the system, always. preferencefalsification :: lying to conform to the most socially acceptableopinion at the time mimetic teory of desire: rather than having our owndesires, we imitate the desires of others and pursue their ideas mimetictheory of conflict :: similar = fight left off on 10! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18120322">on automating outof work</a> The best work isdone when you do it for yourself. you sign your brains away when you goto work for a big company, and these people will likely be B players –no matter how many great people they hire. most A players have moreimportant things to do with their own time. without ownership, there isa high chance that you will not be at your best. non-technical business:: sometimes daily tasks do not end up driving revenue! the others aredriving the revenue, you are maintaining thigns for them. their capacityto define tasks for you may not ever outpace your ability to deliver.automating yourself out of a job could be a goal, but this doesn't work:</p><ul><li>system complexity means something can always break!</li><li>markets rapidly evolve and parts cease to work in the future!</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/?single_page=true">is self-automationethical?</a></p><ul><li>automation and the 15 hour work week from keynes</li><li>though automation continues, humans find ourselves working longer andlonger hours – even though we enjoy benefits from those who useautomation and those who owned automated products.</li><li>Automation still has the power to reduce the amount of boring work wedo.</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-becoming-an-influencer"><a href="/pages/longterm.html#becoming-an-influencer">becoming-an-influencer</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-small-sharp-tools"><a href="/pages/longterm.html#small-sharp-tools">small-sharp-tools</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-working-effectively"><a href="/pages/longterm.html#working-effectively">working-effectively</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-50-ideas-that-changed-my-life"><a href="/pages/longterm.html#50-ideas-that-changed-my-life">50-ideas-that-changed-my-life</a></td></tr></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//longterm.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/pages/web_design.html">web_design</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/pages/messaging.html">messaging</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/pages">pages</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
